=head1 NAME

openssl_user_macros, OPENSSL_API_COMPAT - User defined macros

=head1 DESCRIPTION

User defined macros allow the programmer to control certain aspects of
what is exposed by the OpenSSL headers.

B<NOTE:> to be effective, a user defined macro I<must be defined
before including any header file that depends on it>, either in the
compilation command (C<cc -DMACRO=value>) or by defining the macro in
source before including any headers.

Other manual pages may refer to this page when declarations depend on
user defined macros.

=head2 The macros

=over

=item B<OPENSSL_API_COMPAT>

The value is a version number similar to the
L<OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER(3)> macro.  Any symbol that is deprecated in
versions up to and including the version given in this macro will not
be declared.  Any version number may be given, but these numbers are
the current known major deprecation points, making them the most
meaningful:

=over

=item C<0x00908000L> (version 0.9.8)

=item C<0x10000000L> (version 1.0.0)

=item C<0x10100000L> (version 1.1.0)

=back

If not set, this macro will default to
C<{- join('', map { my @x = split /=/,$_; $x[1] }
              grep /^OPENSSL_MIN_API=/, @{$config{openssl_api_defines} // []})
     || '0x00000000L'
  -}>.
